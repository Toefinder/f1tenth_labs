## Approach
Waypoint following.

Waypoints are generated by running the car manually around the track. These points are then filtered so that we don't have just about enough to follow and not too much to increase amount of computations needed. The car then follows these points using waypoint following algorithm.

The set of waypoints as well as the selected waypoint at each timestep are visualize to check for the correctness. Note that only waypoints in front of the car (local pos_x more than 0) are considered, so that the car won't travel backwards.

## How to run the package

```sh
roslaunch quanganh001_lab6 quanganh001_lab6.launch
```
